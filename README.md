DistributedMatlab
=================
The software is intended to be used for complex mathematical calculations like Matrix Calculations, and this can utilize multiple processors connected through LAN, for running single complex mathematical script. It does not provide you powerful tools as actual Matlab Software does; instead it provides you a simple scripting language in which you can write complex mathematical scripts to solve your problem.
Software can also provide services to other applications running on the same pc or any remote pc connected through LAN. For example, an image processing application can get the benefit of Distributed Processing through this software easily.

The main idea behind this project is to make a system in which we can process a single complex mathematical job on multiple computers and then combine the result on single place. Project utilizes the concept of Distributed Processing.
Project is divided into following subprojects.
	IDE (Integrated Development Environment)
	Scripting Language ( Compiler )
	LocalMachine ( Virtual Machine of Distributed Matlab) 
	RemoteMachine (Remote Virtual Machine)
